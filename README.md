# Computational DMS with alanine scanning data

### Abstract

This project is about predicting DMS scores with alanine scanning data with a machine learning predictor.

Code stored here are used to build the predictors and restore the analysis.

### Run the code

1. Download normalized DMS data and alanine scanning data from the [supplementary files](https://wehieduau-my.sharepoint.com/) and saved them as `./data/normalized/normalized_dms_DeMaSk_features.csv` and `./data/normalized/normalized_alanine_scanning.csv`.
2. DMS data with Envision features should be downloaded from elsewhere (a little bit large to be included, may try zipped version in the future) as `./data/normalized/normalized_dms_Envision_features.csv`.
3. Follow the code and instruction in Jupyter notebook files.
